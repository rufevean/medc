                Our motivation behind this project is to assist individuals facing challenges like forgetting or misunderstanding their medications, such as those with dementia or literacy limitations. Our dispenser simplifies the process for them and their caregivers, ensuring they stay healthy and worry-free amidst obstacles like missed doses or medication errors.

                Our vision extends beyond the current project. We aim to expand our reach and ultimately make our remote-controlled medical dispenser accessible for free to those in need. We aspire to publicize the project to garner support and resources, enabling us to provide essential healthcare solutions to vulnerable populations worldwide.

                We believe in the power of collaboration and welcome contributions from the community. Our project is open-source, and the codebase is available on GitHub for those interested in contributing to our mission.
